    "# Text Classification with Supervised Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of text classification is to classify texts into any number of predefined categories. This method is most similar to traditional content analysis, or text coding, in that it does the same thing as a team of trained coders: place texts into categories. \n",
    "\n",
    "It does require labeled text, or text that is already categorized into predefined categories. In some cases, like ours today, this is built into the data. Labeling text can also be done by hand, as was the case in the reading for today. Once we have a good number of labeled texts, usually between 200 and 500, we can use superivsed machine learning algorithms to train a computer to recognize the categories and place the remaining, un-coded texts into a category. This method has two benefits: (1) It allows us to scale our hand-coding up almost indefinitely, and (2) it identifies what *features* (in our case, words), are most defining of each category. This can help us learn more about the content of our categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will apply supervised machine methods to a corpus distributed by Ted Underwood and Jordan Sellers in support of their own literary historical study on nineteenth- and early-twentieth century volumes of poetry that were reviewed in prestigious magazines versus not at all. (The idea being that even a negative review indicates valuable, critical engagement.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, our task will be to learn the vocabulary of literary prestige, building on the Canon/Archive paper we read early in the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Goals\n",
    "* Get you comfortable with the basic vocabulary around supervised machine learning and text classification\n",
    "* Understand the intuition behind supervised machine learning\n",
    "* Learn how to implement a few key supervised machine learning algorithms\n",
    "* Understand how to test for accuracy\n",
    "* Use scikit-learn to identify important features for each category\n",
    "* Be equipped with foundational knowledge so you can continue to learn, either on your own or by taking more advanced math, machine learning, or text analysis courses\n",

    "    * a machine learning task of inferring a classification from labeled training data.\n",
    "* *features*:\n",
    "    * way of representing the object that will be classified. For images, features are often pixels. For text, features are usually word counts or weighted word counts, but they also also be things like a word's part of speech.\n",

    "* *accuracy*:\n",
    "    * the number of texts the algorithms correctly classifies\n",
